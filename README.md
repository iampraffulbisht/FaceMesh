## Introduction

Face mesh detection is a technique for recognizing and mapping facial landmarks on a face. This project leverages the power of MediaPipe for efficient face mesh detection and OpenCV for video processing and visualization. It provides a real-time demonstration of facial landmark detection and mesh overlay.

## Features

- Real-time face mesh detection from webcam video feed.
- Overlay facial landmarks and mesh on detected faces.
- Display frames per second (FPS) on the video feed.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- pip package manager

### Clone the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iampraffulbisht/FaceMesh.git
   cd facemesh-detection

   
Install Dependencies:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe

Usage:

1.Run the facemesh_detection.py script:
python facemesh_detection.py
2. The script will start capturing video from your webcam. It will detect facial landmarks and display the face mesh along with the FPS on the video feed.
